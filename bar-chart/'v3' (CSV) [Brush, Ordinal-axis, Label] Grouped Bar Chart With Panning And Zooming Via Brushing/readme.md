This grouped bar chart uses brushes along both the x and y axes to allow for zooming and panning behaviour with a visual cue to the user informing them which sections of each axis they are currently viewing.

It is based around multiple examples, mainly:

* [Grouped Bar Chart](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887051)
* [Focus+Context via Brushing](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1667367)
* [Wrapping Long Labels](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7555321)

It adds the extra ability from the [Focus+Context via Brushing](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1667367) brushing example of allowing panning and zooming along an ordinal axis, with credit to [AmeliaBR](http://stackoverflow.com/users/3128209/ameliabr) from this [StackOverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/21492940/403424).

The inspiration for creating this was to achieve a similar experience and functionality to that of Telerik's Silverlight RadChartView component.

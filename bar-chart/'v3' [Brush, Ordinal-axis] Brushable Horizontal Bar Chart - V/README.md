This is exactly the same as [version IV](http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/326fb6de768e85261bfd47aa1f497863) of the brushable horizontal bar chart, but this one has a x scale that updates to fit the largest visible bar in the available width.

For a bit more background, you can read my mini-blog about it [Brushable & interactive bar chart in d3.js](http://www.visualcinnamon.com/2016/07/brush-bar-chart-d3.html)

This example demonstrates how to use D3's brush component to implement focus + context zooming, with sparklines and scatterplots.

Click and drag in the small chart below to pan or zoom.

Sample data is blood pressure readings over time.

Averages for blood-pressure samples in a range are shown at the top.

Mousing over a systolic/diastolic pair highlights the pair.

Clicking on a highlighted systolic/diastolic pair opens a popup.

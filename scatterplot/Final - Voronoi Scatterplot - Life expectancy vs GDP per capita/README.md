This scatterplot is the final visual of my blog on [Using a D3 Voronoi grid to improve a chart's interactive experience](http://www.visualcinnamon.com/2015/07/voronoi.html) in which the tooltip is attached to the circles while the event is triggered by an invisible Voronoi grid that lies over the scatterplot. It also has some other features such as a filtering function when clicking on a region in the legend

You can find all of the steps that led up to this example here

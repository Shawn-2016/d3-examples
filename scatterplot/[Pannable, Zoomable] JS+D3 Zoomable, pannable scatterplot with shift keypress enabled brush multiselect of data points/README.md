## JS+D3: Zoomable, pannable scatterplot with shift keypress enabled brush multiselect of data points

This JS+D3 gist creates a scatterplot with zooming and panning enabled as well as a brush for selecting or deselecting points using the iris dataset within `data.tsv`.

The "Get Selection" button gets the current selection of points and prints their ids to the JS console (i.e. `console.log(selection);`).

The "Clear Selection" button clears the current selection.

##Overview
This is an extension of [Collapsible Tree](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4339083) using [Select2](http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/) to search the tree's leaf nodes.

##Usage
Type the name of a leaf node in the box at the top. This should expand the tree to the depth of that node and highlight the path in red.

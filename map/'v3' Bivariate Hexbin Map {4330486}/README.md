This example shows how to use the [d3.hexbin](https://github.com/d3/d3-plugins/tree/master/hexbin) plugin for hexagonal binning on a map with the `d3.geo.albersUsa` projection. Approximately 3,000 locations of Walmart stores are shown. These are binned into hexagons, and the hexagon area encodes the number of stores that fall into each bin. Color encodes the median age of Walmart stores in that area, with the oldest stores in black and the youngest stores in blue. Inspired by earlier work by [Zachary Forest Johnson](http://indiemaps.com/blog/2011/10/hexbins/).

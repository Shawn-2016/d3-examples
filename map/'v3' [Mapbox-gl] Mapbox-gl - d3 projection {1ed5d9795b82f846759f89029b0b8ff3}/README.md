This example shows how to convert from a Mapbox-gl map projection to a d3.geo Mercator projection.
This allows you to take full advantage of all the d3.geo based functions and examples while also leveraging the power and ease-of-use of mapbox-gl

Much credit goes to [@vicapow](http://twitter.com/vicapow) who developed [viewport-mercator-project](https://github.com/uber-common/viewport-mercator-project) where he figured out the necessary calculations to make this work.

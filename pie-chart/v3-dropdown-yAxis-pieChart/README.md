This example demonstrates how to use [d3.dispatch](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Internals#wiki-d3_dispatch) to coordinate views with shared state. Here, a bar chart and a pie chart show two views of the same data: population by age group for a given state. (For brevity, a legend is omitted.) This example uses two custom events: a *load* event when data is available, and a  *statechange* event when the displayed state is changed.

Custom events allow loose coupling of components: views can listen for events and update the DOM accordingly, without needing to explicitly tie each view together. When the drop-down menu changes, a *statechange* event is triggered which causes any interested listeners to be notified.

Each view uses a unique name, such as "bar" or "pie", so that multiple listeners can be notified for a single event. (D3 requires listeners to be named, rather than anonymous, so that itâ€™s easier to remove or inspect registered listeners.) Thus, the "load.menu", "load.bar" and "load.pie" listeners are all notified when the data is loaded.

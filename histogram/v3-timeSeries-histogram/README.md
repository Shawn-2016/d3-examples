This chart shows a histogram of a [log-normal distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution) of time durations. The data is randomly generated: each value is a number representing a duration measured in minutes. The values are then binned at regular intervals using D3’s [histogram layout](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Histogram-Layout#wiki-histogram). A custom tick format for the *x*-axis converts these numbers to dates before passing them through a [d3.time.format](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Time-Formatting). The *x*-axis uses a linear scale, such that the tick values appear in-between bars; this provides better indication that each bar represents the count of values between its surrounding tick values.
